This pseudocode represent the how a sales person wins the contest based on number of items he sold

create a package, name it that  based on which environment you are working on
import the necessary classes here we need scanner class
create a class named  LargeNumber(follow the naming convention) 
class name should be  related to the functionality we are developing   
create a method called fingLarge(follow naming convention)
In the method follow the below logic
create an object of the scanner class with reference variable 
we have been provided that there are 10 integers entered by the user
create an array of integers and store the input values entered by the user in the array
assume the first number entered is the larger number  
use the for loop and iterate through condition, that is total number of user inputs
starting from the first in each iteration we are using decision making statement 
to find out whether entered number is larger than the previous number 
if the entered number is larger we are making it as larger number so far entered
after all iterations completed we are end up with a one larger number
we are displaying the winner of the sales contest through println statement
